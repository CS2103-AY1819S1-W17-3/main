== Project: MeetingBook

=== Overview
MeetingBook is a desktop scheduling application used for scheduling meetings for NUS modules and CCAs.
The user interacts with it using a command line interface (CLI), and it has a graphical user interface (GUI)
created with JavaFX. MeetingBook is written by a team of 5 students from National University of Singapore's School of
Computing. It is forked from https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY1819S1/addressbook-level4[AddressBook-Level4].
It is written in Java, and has about 10kLoC.

=== Summary of contributions
- Major enhancement: updated the user interface

* How it looks like:
+
image::Ui.png[width="800"]
+
* What it does: allows the user to view all information at a glance.
* Justification: the updated user interface improves the user experience significantly because it reduces the amount of
interaction to look for the information.
* Highlights: this enhancement requires additional enhancement to select, find and list commands to interact with all
interface elements. It requires user to enter additional parameter to commands mentioned.
* Credits: JavaFX

- Minor enhancement:
1. Updated select command to select between groups, meetings or persons. Select groups will filter meeting and person
lists to show only relevant information of the group.
2. Updated list command to show all groups, meetings or persons.

== Contributions to the User Guide

====
Given below are sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write documentation targeting
end-users.
====

=== User Interface
This section will explain the user interface of the application.

image::UiExplanation.png[width="800"]

. Menu bar: provides access to functions
. Group list: displays a list of groups
. Meeting list: displays a list of meetings
. Person list: displays a list of person
. Command box: receives command from user and execute
. Result display: displays the result of command executed
. Update status: displays the update status of current session
. Save path: displays current data save path

=== Selecting a group / person / meeting: `select`

Format: `select [person|group|meeting] [index]` where `[index]` is a positive integer (starts from 1)

****
* If `select [group]` is entered, the person list will be filtered to show only person who belong to the group, and the
meeting list will be filtered to show only meeting scheduled for the group.
* If `select [person]` is entered, only the person that is in the filtered person list will be selected.
* If `select [meeting]` is entered, only the meeting that is in the filtered meeting list will be selected.
****

Examples:

* `select g/1`: selects the first group in the filtered group list.
* `select m/3`: selects the third meeting in the filtered meeting list.
* `select p/2`: selects the second person in the filtered person list.

=== Listing all groups / meetings / persons : `list`

Display all existing groups on the group list / meetings on the meeting list / persons on the person list display.

Format: `list [group|meeting|person]`

[NOTE]
If the list is unfiltered, the list will remain the same.

Examples:

* `list group`: list all groups.
* `list meeting`: list all meetings.
* `list person`: list all persons.

=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[width="800"]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `GroupListPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` change.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the App and updates the UI accordingly.

=== Select feature
==== Current Implementation

The select mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`.
It extends `Model` with two lists, `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueGroupList` and implements the following operations:

* `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` -- Updates person list with a specific `Predicate`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the select mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `ModelManager` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and both `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueGroupList` contains all person and group without filter.

Step 2. The user executes `select g/1` command to select the 1st group in the address book.
The `SelectCommandParser` parses the command to determine the select type, and the command calls executes the following steps:

* Step 2.1. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_GROUP`, a `JumpToGroupListRequestEvent` is sent to update the UI to select the group card,
and `Model#updateFilteredPersonList` is called to filter `UniquePersonList` to contain only person that are associated with the group.

* Step 2.2. If the select type is `SELECT_TYPE_PERSON`, a `JumpToListRequestEvent` is sent to the UI to select the person card.

[NOTE]
If a group is selected, calling `select` command with `SELECT_TYPE_PERSON` will only select the person in the filtered `UniquePersonList` that contains only person in the selected group.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `select` command:
