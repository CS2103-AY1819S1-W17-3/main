== Introduction

Flashbook is for those who prefer to use a desktop app to manage their to-do for university. Flashbook is *designed for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface (CLI)* while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Users who can type fast can navigate and use the to-do list faster than traditional GUI apps. Makes your hand itchy and want to try out? Go to <<Quick Start>> to get started!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java version `9` or later installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `flashbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Flash Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
